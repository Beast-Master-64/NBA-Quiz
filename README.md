NBA Player Quiz:

This is a fun and interactive NBA quiz game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It tests your knowledge of famous basketball players by showing you pictures and asking you to type their names.

Project Description:

The NBA Player Quiz is a web-based game created as my final project for AP Computer Science Principles. It presents a short series of questions about NBA players based on their headshots. The user types in their answers, and at the end of the quiz, the site displays how many questions were answered correctly.

How to Use the Website:

  1. Open the quiz 

  2. A picture of an NBA player will appear with a question.

  3. Type the player's name into the input box and click "Submit."

  4. After three questions, youâ€™ll be taken to the results page to see how many you got correct.


File Structure:

index.html-         Main quiz page

results.html-       Page showing the final score

style.css-          External CSS for layout and design

script.js-          JavaScript logic and event handling


AI Usage:

 - How to compare user answers and correct answers using `.toLowerCase()` for case-insensitive string matching in JavaScript.

 - How to use `localStorage` to store the quiz score and display it on another page (`results.html`).
 
 - How to use `window.location.href` to redirect to a new page after finishing the quiz.

 - How `window.onload` works to automatically run `loadQuestion()` when the page loads.
