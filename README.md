I used AI (ChatGPT) to help me understand and complete the following parts of this project:

- How to compare user answers and correct answers using `.toLowerCase()` for case-insensitive string matching in JavaScript.
- How to use `localStorage` to store the quiz score and display it on another page (`results.html`).
- How to use `window.location.href` to redirect to a new page after finishing the quiz.
- How `window.onload` works to automatically run `loadQuestion()` when the page loads.
